****************************
BigQuery
****************************

The BigQuery connectors uses the JDBC connector for BigQuery.
See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/providers/simba-drivers.
The connector was tested with the JDBC driver `1.2.4`.

WARNING: Using ThirdEye with BigQuery can incur some cost.

TIPS:

1. Use partitioned table, and use the _partitiontime as the time column in the ThirdEye metric. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables.
2. Reserve slots to avoid on-demand query pricing. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro.

**0: Prerequisites**
Rebuild ThirdEye with the specific resources for bigquery:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./install.sh bigquery


**1: Update the data sources configuration**

Add your BigQuery database URL and credentials in `thirdeye-pinot/config/datasources/data-sources-config.yml`. You will be able to add multiple databases with multiple credentials, as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataSourceConfigs:
      - className: org.apache.pinot.thirdeye.datasource.sql.SqlThirdEyeDataSource
        properties:
          BigQuery:
            - db:
                dbname1: jdbc:bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2;ProjectId=PROJECT_ID1;OAuthType=1;
                dbname2: jdbc:bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2;ProjectId=PROJECT_ID2;OAuthType=0;OAuthServiceAcctEmail=thirdeye-sa@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com;OAuthPvtKeyPath=/path/to/thirdeye-sa.json;
              driver: com.simba.googlebigquery.jdbc42.Driver

See how to build the BigQuery url here:
https://www.simba.com/products/BigQuery/doc/JDBC_InstallGuide/content/jdbc/bq/using/connectionurl.htm
You can use different authentication methods ``OAuthType``, see:
https://www.simba.com/products/BigQuery/doc/JDBC_InstallGuide/content/jdbc/bq/options/oauthtype.htm

Note: the `dbname` here is an arbitrary name. For BigQuery you will most likely use something that will recall the project running the BigQuery jobs.


**2: Run ThirdEye frontend**

.. code-block:: bash

    ./run-frontend.sh

**3: Import metric from BigQuery**

See :ref:`import-sql-metric`.

Specificities of BigQuery:

- ``Table Name``: Use back tick, eg: ``\`project_id.dataset_id.table_name\```. You can also unnest in the table name, eg: ``\`project_id.dataset_id.table_name\`,  unnest(repeated_field) as r``

Example of time configuration:

- ``Time column``:  ``UNIX_SECONDS(TIMESTAMP(DATETIME(_PARTITIONTIME)))``
- ``Timezone``: ``UTC``
- ``Time Format``: ``EPOCH``
- ``Time Granularity``: ``1 SECONDS``


**4: Start an analysis**

Point your favorite browser to

``http://localhost:1426/app/#/rootcause``

and type any data set or metric name (fragment) in the search box. Auto-complete will now list the names of matching metrics. Select any metric to start an investigation.
